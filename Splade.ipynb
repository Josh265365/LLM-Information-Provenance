As Atticus had once advised me to do, I \\ntried to climb into Jem’s skin and walk around in it: if I had gone alone to the \\nRadley Place at two in the morning, my funeral would have been held the next \\nafternoon. So I left Jem alone and tried not to bother him. School started. The second grade was as bad as the first, only worse—they still \\nflashed cards at you and wouldn’t let you read or write. Miss Caroline’s progress \\nnext door could be estimated by the frequency of laughter; however, the usual \\ncrew had flunked the first grade again, and were helpful in keeping order. The \\nonly thing good about the second grade was that this year I had to stay as late as \\nJem, and we usually walked home together at three o’clock. One afternoon when we were crossing the schoolyard toward home, Jem suddenly \\nsaid: “There’s something I didn’t tell you.”\\n As this was his first complete sentence in several days, I encouraged him: “About \\nwhat?”\\n “About that night.”\\n “You’ve never told me anything about that night,” I said. Jem waved my words away as if fanning gnats. He was silent for a while, then he \\nsaid, “When I went back for my breeches—they were all in a tangle when I was \\ngettin‘ out of ’em, I couldn’t get ‘em loose. When I went back—” Jem took a \\ndeep breath. “When I went back, they were folded across the fence… like they \\nwere expectin’ me.”\\n “Across—”\\n “And something else—” Jem’s voice was flat. “Show you when we get home. They’d been sewed up. Not like a lady sewed ‘em, like somethin’ I’d try to do. All crooked. It’s almost like—”\\n “—somebody knew you were comin‘ back for ’em.”\\n Jem shuddered. “Like somebody was readin‘ my mind… like somebody could tell \\nwhat I was gonna do.'}\n"

Mr. Thompson, the elderly man from down the street, watched us from his window, much like Atticus did, with a quiet kindness that never needed words. He told stories of the cotton mills and the war, weaving history into our summer like the pages of a well-loved book. One afternoon, we found a stray dog, scruffy and trembling beneath an old lamppost. We named him Boo, after the mysterious neighbor who never left his house. Taking care of Boo felt like a secret rebellion against the harshness of the world outside our doorstep.That summer taught me about kindness, courage, and the beauty hidden in ordinary places — lessons as enduring as any told beneath the Southern sun. Manchester’s streets became my Maycomb, and its people, my family.\")\n",

I was ten, navigating the cobbled streets with Jem and Scout’s spirit in my heart, though our playground was Hulme and not Maycomb.Our days were spent in the shadow of red-brick terraces, where the scent of freshly baked pies mingled with the distant hum of trams. Mr. Thompson, the elderly man from down the street, watched us from his window, much like Atticus did, with a quiet kindness that never needed words. He told stories of the cotton mills and the war, weaving history into our summer like the pages of a well-loved book. One afternoon, we found a stray dog, scruffy and trembling beneath an old lamppost. We named him Boo, after the mysterious neighbor who never left his house. Taking care of Boo felt like a secret rebellion against the harshness of the world outside our doorstep.That summer taught me about kindness, courage, and the beauty hidden in ordinary places — lessons as enduring as any told beneath the Southern sun. Manchester’s streets became my Maycomb, and its people, my family.\")\n",
