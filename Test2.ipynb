Jem and Scout Finch sat on the porch steps, their bare feet dangling, watching the world with wide, curious eyes. It was the kind of afternoon where time seemed to slow, yet the air was thick with a tension they couldn’t quite name.\\nTommy Harris was new in town, a shy boy with a crooked smile who kept to himself. One afternoon, a window shattered at the church, and fingers quickly pointed toward Tommy. Rumors swirled — some said he was clumsy, others whispered darker things. But Jem and Scout, knowing the boy’s quiet kindness, couldn’t believe he was guilty of such mischief.\\nAtticus, their father, sat stiffly at the kitchen table, the weight of the town’s silent judgments pressing down on him. “Sometimes,” he said, “people see what they expect to see, not what is true.” His voice was calm, but Scout caught the flicker of sadness in his eyes.\\nThe trial was a schoolyard spectacle. Tommy, nervous and small against the towering accusations, tried to explain, but his innocence was swallowed by suspicion. The town’s fear painted him in shades of guilt, a stark contrast to the gentle boy Jem and Scout knew.\\nIn the end, it wasn’t the truth that won, but the loudest voices in the room. Jem and Scout learned that innocence, like a fragile flower, can be mistaken for something else entirely — a shadow cast longer by fear and misunderstanding. And in that small town, where the line between right and wrong blurred with the setting sun, the children held tight to the hope that one day, truth would find its way back to the light.\"\n",
