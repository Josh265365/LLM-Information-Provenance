introduce me to boo radley at a time like this wellthat was atticus boo saw me run instinctively to the bed where jem was sleeping for the same shy smile crept across his face hot with embarrassment i tried to cover up by covering jem up ah ah don't touch him atticus said mr heck tate sat looking intently at boo through his horn rimmed glasses he was about to speak when dr reynolds came down the hall everybody out he said as he came in the door evenin' arthur didn't notice you the first time i was here dr reynolds's voice was as breezy as his step as though he had said it every evening of his life an announcement that astounded me even more than being in the same room with boo radley of course even boo radley got sick sometimes i thought but on the other hand i wasn't sure dr reynolds was carrying a big package wrapped in newspaper he put it down on jem's desk and took off his coat you're quite satisfied he's alive now tell you how i knew when i tried to examine him he kicked me had to put him out good and proper to touch him so scat he said to me er said atticus glancing at boo heck let's go out on the front porch there are plenty of chairs out there and it's still warm enough i wondered why atticus was inviting us to the front porch instead of the livingroom then i understood the livingroom lights were awfully strong we filed out first mr tateatticus was waiting at the door for him to go ahead of him then he changed his mind and followed mr tate people have a habit of doing everyday things even under the oddest conditions i was no exception come along mr arthur i heard myself saying you don't know the house real well i'll just take you to the porch sir he looked down at me and nodded i led him through the hall and past the livingroom won't you have a seat mr arthur this rocking chair's nice and comfortable my small fantasy about him was alive again he would be sitting on the porch right pretty spell we're having isn't it mr arthur yes a right pretty spell feeling slightly unreal i led him to the chair farthest from atticus and mr tate it was in deep shadow boo would feel more comfortable in the dark atticus was sitting in the swing and mr tate was in a chair next to him the light from the livingroom windows was strong on them i sat beside boo well heck atticus was saying i guess the thing to dogood lord i'm losing my memory atticus pushed up his glasses and pressed his fingers to his eyes jem's not quite thirteen no he's already thirteeni can't remember anyway it'll come before county court what will mr finch mr tate uncrossed his legs and leaned forward of course it was clear cut self defense but i'll have to go to the office and hunt up mr finch do you think jem killed bob ewell do you think that you heard what scout said there's no doubt about it she said jem got up and yanked him off herhe probably got hold of ewell's knife somehow in the dark we'll find out tomorrow mis ter finch hold on said mr tate jem never stabbed bob ewell atticus was silent for a moment he looked at mr tate as if he appreciated what he said but atticus shook his head heck it's mighty kind of you and i know you're doing it from that good heart of yours but don't start anything like that mr tate got up and went to the edge of the porch he spat into the shrubbery then thrust his hands into his hip pockets and faced atticus like what he said i'm sorry if i spoke sharply heck atticus said simply but nobody's hushing this up i don't live that way nobody's gonna hush anything up mr finch mr tate's voice was quiet but his boots were planted so solidly on the porch floorboards it seemed that they grew there a curious contest the nature of which eluded me was developing between my father and the sheriff it was atticus's turn to get up and go to the edge of the porch he said h'rm and spat dryly into the yard he put his hands in his pockets and faced mr tate heck you haven't said it but i know what you're thinking thank you for it jean louise he turned to me you said jem yanked mr ewell off you yes sir that's what i thought i see there heck thank you from the bottom of my heart but i don't want my boy starting out with something like this over his head best way to clear the air is to have it all out in the open let the county come and bring sandwiches i don't want him growing up with a whisper about him i don't want anybody saying 'jem finch his daddy paid a mint to get him out of that' sooner we get this over with the better mr finch mr tate said stolidly bob ewell fell on his knife he killed himself atticus walked to the corner of the porch he looked at the wisteria vine in his own way i thought each was as stubborn as the other i wondered who would give in first atticus's stubbornness was quiet and rarely evident but in some ways he was as set as the cunninghams mr tate's was unschooled and blunt but it was equal to my father's heck atticus's back was turned if this thing's hushed up it'll be a simple denial to jem of the way i've tried to raise him sometimes i think i'm a total failure as a parent but i'm all they've got before jem looks at anyone else he looks at me and i've tried to live so i can look squarely back at him if i connived at something like this frankly i couldn't meet his eye and the day i can't do that i'll know i've lost him i don't want to lose him and scout because they're all i've got mr finch mr tate was still planted to the floorboards bob ewell fell on his knife i can prove it atticus wheeled around his hands dug into his pockets heck can't you even try to see it my way you've got children of your own but i'm older than you when mine are grown i'll be an old man if i'm still around but right now i'mif they don't trust me they won't trust anybody jem and scout know what happened if they hear of me saying downtown something different happened heck i won't have them any more i can't live one way in town and another way in my home mr tate rocked on his heels and said patiently he'd flung jem down he stumbled over a root under that tree andlook i can show you mr tate reached in his side pocket and withdrew a long switchblade knife as he did so dr reynolds came to the door the sondeceased's under that tree doctor just inside the schoolyard got a flashlight better have this one i can ease around and turn my car lights on said dr reynolds but he took mr tate's flashlight jem's all right he won't wake up tonight i hope so don't worry that the knife that killed him heck no sir still in him looked like a kitchen knife from the handle ken oughta be there with the hearse by now doctor 'night mr tate flicked open the knife it was like this he said he held the knife and pretended to stumble as he leaned forward his left arm went down in front of him see there stabbed himself through that soft stuff between his ribs his whole weight drove it in mr tate closed the knife and jammed it back in his pocket scout is eight years old he said she was too scared to know exactly what went on you'd be surprised atticus said grimly i'm not sayin' she made it up i'm sayin' she was too scared to know exactly what happened it was mighty dark out there black as ink 'd take somebody mighty used to the dark to make a competent witness i won't have it atticus said softly god damn it i'm not thinking of jem mr tate's boot hit the floorboards so hard the lights in miss maudie's bedroom went on miss stephanie crawford's lights went on atticus and mr tate looked across the street then at each other they waited when mr tate spoke again his voice was barely audible mr finch i hate to fight you when you're like this you've been under a strain tonight no man should ever have to go through why you ain't in the bed from it i don't know but i do know that for once you haven't been able to put two and two together and we've got to settle this tonight because tomorrow'll be too late bob ewell's got a kitchen knife in his craw mr tate added that atticus wasn't going to stand there and maintain that any boy jem's size with a busted arm had fight enough left in him to tackle and kill a grown man in the pitch dark heck said atticus abruptly that was a switchblade you were waving where'd you get it took it off a drunk man mr tate answered coolly i was trying to remember mr ewell was on me then he went down jem must have gotten up at least i thought heck i said i took it off a drunk man downtown tonight ewell probably found that kitchen knife in the dump somewhere honed it down and bided his time just bided his time atticus made his way to the swing and sat down his hands dangled limply between his knees he was looking at the floor he had moved with the same slowness that night in front of the jail when i thought it took him forever to fold his newspaper and toss it in his chair mr tate clumped softly around the porch it ain't your decision mr finch it's all mine it's my decision and my responsibility for once if you don't see it my way there's not much you can do about it if you wanta try i'll call you a liar to your face your boy never stabbed bob ewell he said slowly didn't come near a mile of it and now you know it all he wanted to do was get him and his sister safely home mr tate stopped pacing he stopped in front of atticus and his back was to us i'm not a very good man sir but i am sheriff of maycomb county lived in this town all my life an' i'm goin' on forty three years old know everything that's happened here since before i was born there's a black boy dead for no reason and the man responsible for it's dead let the dead bury the dead this time mr finch let the dead bury the dead mr tate went to the swing and picked up his hat it was lying beside atticus mr tate pushed back his hair and put his hat on i never heard tell that it's against the law for a citizen to do his utmost to prevent a crime from being committed which is exactly what he did but maybe you'll say it's my duty to tell the town all about it and not hush it up know what'd happen then all the ladies in maycomb includin' my wife'd be knocking on his door bringing angel food cakes to my way of thinkin' mr finch taking the one man who's done you and this town a great service an' draggin' him with his shy ways into the limelightto me that's a sin it's a sin and i'm not about to have it on my head if it was any other man it'd be different but not this man mr finch mr tate was trying to dig a hole in the floor with the toe of his boot he pulled his nose then he massaged his left arm i may not be much mr finch but i'm still sheriff of maycomb county and bob ewell fell on his knife good night sir mr tate stamped off the porch and strode across the front yard his car door slammed and he drove away atticus sat looking at the floor for a long time finally he raised his head scout he said mr ewell fell on his knife can you possibly understand atticus looked like he needed cheering up i ran to him and hugged him and kissed him with all my might yes sir i understand i reassured him mr tate was right atticus disengaged himself and looked at me what do you mean well it'd be sort of like shootin' a mockingbird wouldn't it atticus put his face in my hair and rubbed it when he got up and walked across the porch into the shadows his youthful step had returned before he went inside the house he stopped in front of boo radley thank you for my children arthur he said\"}\n"

Little Elsie and her brother, Tom, chased each other past red buses and the scent of fresh bread from the corner bakery. The hum of the city softened beneath the warmth, as if even the factories paused to breathe. Mrs. Clarke, sitting by her window, watched them with a gentle smile, recalling her own childhood summers. In that fleeting golden hour, the city’s edge softened—where innocence met resilience, and every small moment held the promise of something kinder, something just beyond the horizon.'"

      "'text': calpurnia wore her stiffest starched apron she carried a tray of charlotte she backed up to the swinging door and pressed gently i admired the ease and grace with which she handled heavy loads of dainty things so did aunt alexandra i guess because she had let calpurnia serve today august was on the brink of september dill would be leaving for meridian tomorrow today he was off with jem at barker's eddy jem had discovered with angry amazement that nobody had ever bothered to teach dill how to swim a skill jem considered necessary as walking they had spent two afternoons at the creek they said they were going in naked and i couldn't come so i divided the lonely hours between calpurnia and miss maudie today aunt alexandra and her missionary circle were fighting the good fight all over the house from the kitchen i heard mrs grace merriweather giving a report in the livingroom on the squalid lives of the mrunas it sounded like to me they put the women out in huts when their time came whatever that was they had no sense of familyi knew that'd distress auntythey subjected children to terrible ordeals when they were thirteen they were crawling with yaws and earworms they chewed up and spat out the bark of a tree into a communal pot and then got drunk on it immediately thereafter the ladies adjourned for refreshments i didn't know whether to go into the diningroom or stay out aunt alexandra told me to join them for refreshments it was not necessary that i attend the business part of the meeting she said it'd bore me i was wearing my pink sunday dress shoes and a petticoat and reflected that if i spilled anything calpurnia would have to wash my dress again for tomorrow this had been a busy day for her i decided to stay out can i help you cal i asked wishing to be of some service calpurnia paused in the doorway you be still as a mouse in that corner she said an' you can help me load up the trays when i come back the gentle hum of ladies' voices grew louder as she opened the door why alexandra i never saw such charlotte just lovely i never can get my crust like this never can who'd've thought of little dewberry tarts calpurnia who'da thought it anybody tell you that the preacher's wife's nooo well she is and that other one not walkin' yet they became quiet and i knew they had all been served calpurnia returned and put my mother's heavy silver pitcher on a tray this coffee pitcher's a curiosity she murmured they don't make 'em these days can i carry it in if you be careful and don't drop it set it down at the end of the table by miss alexandra down there by the cups'n things she's gonna pour i tried pressing my behind against the door as calpurnia had done but the door didn't budge grinning she held it open for me careful now it's heavy don't look at it and you won't spill it my journey was successful aunt alexandra smiled brilliantly stay with us jean louise she said this was a part of her campaign to teach me to be a lady it was customary for every circle hostess to invite her neighbors in for refreshments be they baptists or presbyterians which accounted for the presence of miss rachel sober as a judge miss maudie and miss stephanie crawford rather nervous i took a seat beside miss maudie and wondered why ladies put on their hats to go across the street ladies in bunches always filled me with vague apprehension and a firm desire to be elsewhere but this feeling was what aunt alexandra called being spoiled the ladies were cool in fragile pastel prints most of them were heavily powdered but unrouged the only lipstick in the room was tangee natural cutex natural sparkled on their fingernails but some of the younger ladies wore rose they smelled heavenly i sat quietly having conquered my hands by tightly gripping the arms of the chair and waited for someone to speak to me miss maudie's gold bridgework twinkled you're mighty dressed up miss jean louise she said where are your britches today under my dress i hadn't meant to be funny but the ladies laughed my cheeks grew hot as i realized my mistake but miss maudie looked gravely down at me she never laughed at me unless i meant to be funny in the sudden silence that followed miss stephanie crawford called from across the room whatcha going to be when you grow up jean louise a lawyer nome i hadn't thought about it i answered grateful that miss stephanie was kind enough to change the subject hurriedly i began choosing my vocation nurse aviator well why shoot i thought you wanted to be a lawyer you've already commenced going to court the ladies laughed again that stephanie's a card somebody said miss stephanie was encouraged to pursue the subject don't you want to grow up to be a lawyer miss maudie's hand touched mine and i answered mildly enough nome just a lady miss stephanie eyed me suspiciously decided that i meant no impertinence and contented herself with well you won't get very far until you start wearing dresses more often miss maudie's hand closed tightly on mine and i said nothing its warmth was enough mrs grace merriweather sat on my left and i felt it would be polite to talk to her mr merriweather a faithful methodist under duress apparently saw nothing personal in singing amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me it was the general opinion of maycomb however that mrs merriweather had sobered him up and made a reasonably useful citizen of him for certainly mrs merriweather was the most devout lady in maycomb i searched for a topic of interest to her what did you all study this afternoon i asked oh child those poor mrunas she said and was off few other questions would be necessary mrs merriweather's large brown eyes always filled with tears when she considered the oppressed living in that jungle with nobody but j grimes everett she said not a white person'll go near 'em but that saintly j grimes everett mrs merriweather played her voice like an organ every word she said received its full measure the poverty the darkness the immoralitynobody but j grimes everett knows you know when the church gave me that trip to the camp grounds j grimes everett said to me was he there ma'am i thought home on leave j grimes everett said to me he said 'mrs merriweather you have no conception no conception of what we are fighting over there' that's what he said to me yes ma'am i said to him 'mr everett' i said 'the ladies of the maycomb alabama methodist episcopal church south are behind you one hundred percent' that's what i said to him and you know right then and there i made a pledge in my heart i said to myself when i go home i'm going to give a course on the mrunas and bring j grimes everett's message to maycomb and that's just what i'm doing yes ma'am when mrs merriweather shook her head her black curls jiggled jean louise she said you are a fortunate girl you live in a christian home with christian folks in a christian town out there in j grimes everett's land there's nothing but sin and squalor yes ma'am sin and squalorwhat was that gertrude mrs merriweather turned on her chimes for the lady sitting beside her oh that well i always say forgive and forget forgive and forget thing that church ought to do is help her lead a christian life for those children from here on out some of the men ought to go out there and tell that preacher to encourage her excuse me mrs merriweather i interrupted are you all talking about mayella ewell may no child that darky's wife tom's wife tom robinson ma'am mrs merriweather turned back to her neighbor there's one thing i truly believe gertrude she continued but some people just don't see it my way if we just let them know we forgive 'em that we've forgotten it then this whole thing'll blow over ahmrs merriweather i interrupted once more what'll blow over again she turned to me mrs merriweather was one of those childless adults who find it necessary to assume a different tone of voice when speaking to children nothing jean louise she said in stately largo the cooks and field hands are just dissatisfied but they're settling down nowthey grumbled all next day after that trial mrs merriweather faced mrs farrow gertrude i tell you there's nothing more distracting than a sulky darky their mouths go down to here just ruins your day to have one of 'em in the kitchen you know what i said to my sophy gertrude i said 'sophy' i said 'you simply are not being a christian today jesus christ never went around grumbling and complaining' and you know it did her good she took her eyes off that floor and said 'nome miz merriweather jesus never went around grumblin'' i tell you gertrude you never ought to let an opportunity go by to witness for the lord i was reminded of the ancient little organ in the chapel at finch's landing when i was very small and if i had been very good during the day atticus would let me pump its bellows while he picked out a tune with one finger the last note would linger as long as there was air to sustain it mrs merriweather had run out of air i judged and was replenishing her supply while mrs farrow composed herself to speak mrs farrow was a splendidly built woman with pale eyes and narrow feet she had a fresh permanent wave and her hair was a mass of tight gray ringlets she was the second most devout lady in maycomb she had a curious habit of prefacing everything she said with a soft sibilant sound s s s grace she said it's just like i was telling brother hutson the other day 's s s brother hutson' i said 'looks like we're fighting a losing battle a losing battle' i said 's s s it doesn't matter to 'em one bit we can educate 'em till we're blue in the face we can try till we drop to make christians out of 'em but there's no lady safe in her bed these nights' he said to me 'mrs farrow i don't know what we're coming to down here' s s s i told him that was certainly a fact mrs merriweather nodded wisely her voice soared over the clink of coffee cups and the soft bovine sounds of the ladies munching their dainties gertrude she said i tell you there are some good but misguided people in this town good but misguided folks in this town who think they're doing right i mean now far be it from me to say who but some of 'em in this town thought they were doing the right thing a while back but all they did was stir 'em up that's all they did might've looked like the right thing to do at the time i'm sure i don't know i'm not read in that field but sulky dissatisfied i tell you if my sophy'd kept it up another day i'd have let her go it's never entered that wool of hers that the only reason i keep her is because this depression's on and she needs her dollar and a quarter every week she can get it his food doesn't stick going down does it miss maudie said it two tight lines had appeared at the corners of her mouth she had been sitting silently beside me her coffee cup balanced on one knee i had lost the thread of conversation long ago when they quit talking about tom robinson's wife and had contented myself with thinking of finch's landing and the river aunt alexandra had got it backwards the business part of the meeting was blood curdling the social hour was dreary maudie i'm sure i don't know what you mean said mrs merriweather i'm sure you do miss maudie said shortly she said no more when miss maudie was angry her brevity was icy something had made her deeply angry and her gray eyes were as cold as her voice mrs merriweather reddened glanced at me and looked away i could not see mrs farrow aunt alexandra got up from the table and swiftly passed more refreshments neatly engaging mrs merriweather and mrs gates in brisk conversation when she had them well on the road with mrs perkins aunt alexandra stepped back she gave miss maudie a look of pure gratitude and i wondered at the world of women miss maudie and aunt alexandra had never been especially close and here was aunty silently thanking her for something for what i knew not i was content to learn that aunt alexandra could be pierced sufficiently to feel gratitude for help given there was no doubt about it i must soon enter this world where on its surface fragrant ladies rocked slowly fanned gently and drank cool water but i was more at home in my father's world people like mr heck tate did not trap you with innocent questions to make fun of you even jem was not highly critical unless you said something stupid ladies seemed to live in faint horror of men seemed unwilling to approve wholeheartedly of them but i liked them there was something about them no matter how much they cussed and drank and gambled and chewed no matter how undelectable they were there was something about them that i instinctively liked they weren't hypocrites mrs perkins born hypocrites mrs merriweather was saying at least we don't have that sin on our shoulders down here people up there set 'em free but you don't see 'em settin' at the table with 'em at least we don't have the deceit to say to 'em yes you're as good as we are but stay away from us down here we just say you live your way and we'll live ours i think that woman that mrs roosevelt's lost her mindjust plain lost her mind coming down to birmingham and tryin' to sit with 'em if i was the mayor of birmingham i'd well neither of us was the mayor of birmingham but i wished i was the governor of alabama for one day i'd let tom robinson go so quick the missionary society wouldn't have time to catch its breath calpurnia was telling miss rachel's cook the other day how bad tom was taking things and she didn't stop talking when i came into the kitchen she said there wasn't a thing atticus could do to make being shut up easier for him that the last thing he said to atticus before they took him down to the prison camp was good bye mr finch there ain't nothin' you can do now so there ain't no use tryin' calpurnia said atticus told her that the day they took tom to prison he just gave up hope she said atticus tried to explain things to him and that he must do his best not to lose hope because atticus was doing his best to get him free miss rachel's cook asked calpurnia why didn't atticus just say yes you'll go free and leave it at that seemed like that'd be a big comfort to tom calpurnia said because you ain't familiar with the law first thing you learn when you're in a lawin' family is that there ain't any definite answers to anything mr finch couldn't say somethin's so when he doesn't know for sure it's so the front door slammed and i heard atticus's footsteps in the hall automatically i wondered what time it was not nearly time for him to be home and on missionary society days he usually stayed downtown until black dark he stopped in the doorway his hat was in his hand and his face was white excuse me ladies he said go right ahead with your meeting don't let me disturb you alexandra could you come to the kitchen a minute i want to borrow calpurnia for a while he didn't go through the diningroom but went down the back hallway and entered the kitchen from the rear door aunt alexandra and i met him the diningroom door opened again and miss maudie joined us calpurnia had half risen from her chair cal atticus said i want you to go with me out to helen robinson's house what's the matter aunt alexandra asked alarmed by the look on my father's face tom's dead aunt alexandra put her hands to her mouth they shot him said atticus he was running it was during their exercise period they said he just broke into a blind raving charge at the fence and started climbing over right in front of them didn't they try to stop him didn't they give him any warning aunt alexandra's voice shook oh yes the guards called to him to stop they fired a few shots in the air then to kill they got him just as he went over the fence they said if he'd had two good arms he'd have made it he was moving that fast seventeen bullet holes in him they didn't have to shoot him that much cal i want you to come out with me and help me tell helen yes sir she murmured fumbling at her apron miss maudie went to calpurnia and untied it this is the last straw atticus aunt alexandra said depends on how you look at it he said what was one negro more or less among two hundred of 'em he wasn't tom to them he was an escaping prisoner atticus leaned against the refrigerator pushed up his glasses and rubbed his eyes we had such a good chance he said i told him what i thought but i couldn't in truth say that we had more than a good chance i guess tom was tired of white men's chances and preferred to take his own ready cal yessir mr finch then let's go aunt alexandra sat down in calpurnia's chair and put her hands to her face she sat quite still she was so quiet i wondered if she would faint i heard miss maudie breathing as if she had just climbed the steps and in the diningroom the ladies chattered happily i thought aunt alexandra was crying but when she took her hands away from her face she was not she looked weary she spoke and her voice was flat i can't say i approve of everything he does maudie but he's my brother and i just want to know when this will ever end her voice rose it tears him to pieces he doesn't show it much but it tears him to pieces i've seen him when what else do they want from him maudie what else what does who want alexandra miss maudie asked i mean this town they're perfectly willing to let him do what they're too afraid to do themselvesit might lose 'em a nickel they're perfectly willing to let him wreck his health doing what they're afraid to do they're be quiet they'll hear you said miss maudie have you ever thought of it this way alexandra whether maycomb knows it or not we're paying the highest tribute we can pay a man we trust him to do right it's that simple who aunt alexandra never knew she was echoing her twelve year old nephew the handful of people in this town who say that fair play is not marked white only the handful of people who say a fair trial is for everybody not just us the handful of people with enough humility to think when they look at a negro there but for the lord's kindness am l miss maudie's old crispness was returning the handful of people in this town with background that's who they are had i been attentive i would have had another scrap to add to jem's definition of background but i found myself shaking and couldn't stop i had seen enfield prison farm and atticus had pointed out the exercise yard to me it was the size of a football field stop that shaking commanded miss maudie and i stopped get up alexandra we've left 'em long enough aunt alexandra rose and smoothed the various whalebone ridges along her hips she took her handkerchief from her belt and wiped her nose she patted her hair and said do i show it not a sign said miss maudie are you together again jean louise yes ma'am then let's join the ladies she said grimly their voices swelled when miss maudie opened the door to the diningroom aunt alexandra was ahead of me and i saw her head go up as she went through the door oh mrs perkins she said you need some more coffee let me get it calpurnia's on an errand for a few minutes grace said miss maudie let me pass you some more of those dewberry tarts 'dyou hear what that cousin of mine did the other day the one who likes to go fishing and so they went down the row of laughing women around the diningroom refilling coffee cups dishing out goodies as though their only regret was the temporary domestic disaster of losing calpurnia the gentle hum began again yes sir mrs perkins that j grimes everett is a martyred saint he needed to get married so they ran to the beauty parlor every saturday afternoon soon as the sun goes down he goes to bed with the chickens a crate full of sick chickens fred says that's what started it all fred says aunt alexandra looked across the room at me and smiled she looked at a tray of cookies on the table and nodded at them i carefully picked up the tray and watched myself walk to mrs merriweather with my best company manners i asked her if she would have some after all if aunty could be a lady at a time like this so could i\n",

      "'text': my nagging got the better of jem eventually as i knew it would and to my relief we slowed down the game for a while he still maintained however that atticus hadn't said we couldn't therefore we could and if atticus ever said we couldn't jem had thought of a way around it he would simply change the names of the characters and then we couldn't be accused of playing anything dill was in hearty agreement with this plan of action dill was becoming something of a trial anyway following jem about he had asked me earlier in the summer to marry him then he promptly forgot about it he staked me out marked as his property said i was the only girl he would ever love then he neglected me i beat him up twice but it did no good he only grew closer to jem they spent days together in the treehouse plotting and planning calling me only when they needed a third party but i kept aloof from their more foolhardy schemes for a while and on pain of being called a girl i spent most of the remaining twilights that summer sitting with miss maudie atkinson on her front porch jem and i had always enjoyed the free run of miss maudie's yard if we kept out of her azaleas but our contact with her was not clearly defined until jem and dill excluded me from their plans she was only another lady in the neighborhood but a relatively benign presence our tacit treaty with miss maudie was that we could play on her lawn eat her scuppernongs if we didn't jump on the arbor and explore her vast back lot terms so generous we seldom spoke to her so careful were we to preserve the delicate balance of our relationship but jem and dill drove me closer to her with their behavior miss maudie hated her house time spent indoors was time wasted she was a widow a chameleon lady who worked in her flower beds in an old straw hat and men's coveralls but after her five o'clock bath she would appear on the porch and reign over the street in magisterial beauty she loved everything that grew in god's earth even the weeds with one exception if she found a blade of nut grass in her yard it was like the second battle of the marne she swooped down upon it with a tin tub and subjected it to blasts from beneath with a poisonous substance she said was so powerful it'd kill us all if we didn't stand out of the way why can't you just pull it up i asked after witnessing a prolonged campaign against a blade not three inches high pull it up child pull it up she picked up the limp sprout and squeezed her thumb up its tiny stalk microscopic grains oozed out why one sprig of nut grass can ruin a whole yard look here when it comes fall this dries up and the wind blows it all over maycomb county miss maudie's face likened such an occurrence unto an old testament pestilence her speech was crisp for a maycomb county inhabitant she called us by all our names and when she grinned she revealed two minute gold prongs clipped to her eyeteeth when i admired them and hoped i would have some eventually she said look here with a click of her tongue she thrust out her bridgework a gesture of cordiality that cemented our friendship miss maudie's benevolence extended to jem and dill whenever they paused in their pursuits we reaped the benefits of a talent miss maudie had hitherto kept hidden from us she made the best cakes in the neighborhood when she was admitted into our confidence every time she baked she made a big cake and three little ones and she would call across the street jem finch scout finch charles baker harris come here our promptness was always rewarded in summertime twilights are long and peaceful often as not miss maudie and i would sit silently on her porch watching the sky go from yellow to pink as the sun went down watching flights of martins sweep low over the neighborhood and disappear behind the schoolhouse rooftops miss maudie i said one evening do you think boo radley's still alive his name's arthur and he's alive she said she was rocking slowly in her big oak chair do you smell my mimosa it's like angels' breath this evening yessum how do you know know what child that bmr arthur's still alive what a morbid question but i suppose it's a morbid subject i know he's alive jean louise because i haven't seen him carried out yet maybe he died and they stuffed him up the chimney where did you get such a notion that's what jem said he thought they did s ss ss he gets more like jack finch every day miss maudie had known uncle jack finch atticus's brother since they were children nearly the same age they had grown up together at finch's landing miss maudie was the daughter of a neighboring landowner dr frank buford dr buford's profession was medicine and his obsession was anything that grew in the ground so he stayed poor uncle jack finch confined his passion for digging to his window boxes in nashville and stayed rich we saw uncle jack every christmas and every christmas he yelled across the street for miss maudie to come marry him miss maudie would yell back call a little louder jack finch and they'll hear you at the post office i haven't heard you yet jem and i thought this a strange way to ask for a lady's hand in marriage but then uncle jack was rather strange he said he was trying to get miss maudie's goat that he had been trying unsuccessfully for forty years that he was the last person in the world miss maudie would think about marrying but the first person she thought about teasing and the best defense to her was spirited offense all of which we understood clearly arthur radley just stays in the house that's all said miss maudie wouldn't you stay in the house if you didn't want to come out yessum but i'd wanta come out why doesn't he miss maudie's eyes narrowed you know that story as well as i do i never heard why though nobody ever told me why miss maudie settled her bridgework you know old mr radley was a foot washing baptist that's what you are ain't it my shell's not that hard child i'm just a baptist don't you all believe in foot washing we do at home in the bathtub but we can't have communion with you all apparently deciding that it was easier to define primitive baptistry than closed communion miss maudie said foot washers believe anything that's pleasure is a sin did you know some of 'em came out of the woods one saturday and passed by this place and told me me and my flowers were going to hell your flowers too yes ma'am they'd burn right with me they thought i spent too much time in god's outdoors and not enough time inside the house reading the bible my confidence in pulpit gospel lessened at the vision of miss maudie stewing forever in various protestant hells true enough she had an acid tongue in her head and she did not go about the neighborhood doing good as did miss stephanie crawford but while no one with a grain of sense trusted miss stephanie jem and i had considerable faith in miss maudie she had never told on us had never played cat and mouse with us she was not at all interested in our private lives she was our friend how so reasonable a creature could live in peril of everlasting torment was incomprehensible that ain't right miss maudie you're the best lady i know miss maudie grinned thank you ma'am thing is foot washers think women are a sin by definition they take the bible literally you know is that why mr arthur stays in the house to keep away from women i've no idea it doesn't make sense to me looks like if mr arthur was hankerin' after heaven he'd come out on the porch at least atticus says god's loving folks like you love yourself miss maudie stopped rocking and her voice hardened you are too young to understand it she said but sometimes the bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hand ofoh of your father i was shocked atticus doesn't drink whiskey i said he never drunk a drop in his lifenome yes he did he said he drank some one time and didn't like it miss maudie laughed wasn't talking about your father she said what i meant was if atticus finch drank until he was drunk he wouldn't be as hard as some men are at their best there are just some kind of men whowho're so busy worrying about the next world they've never learned to live in this one and you can look down the street and see the results do you think they're true all those things they say about bmr arthur what things i told her that is three fourths colored folks and one fourth stephanie crawford said miss maudie grimly stephanie crawford even told me once she woke up in the middle of the night and found him looking in the window at her i said what did you do stephanie move over in the bed and make room for him that shut her up a while i was sure it did miss maudie's voice was enough to shut anybody up no child she said that is a sad house i remember arthur radley when he was a boy he always spoke nicely to me no matter what folks said he did spoke as nicely as he knew how you reckon he's crazy miss maudie shook her head if he's not he should be by now the things that happen to people we never really know what happens in houses behind closed doors what secrets atticus don't ever do anything to jem and me in the house that he don't do in the yard i said feeling it my duty to defend my parent gracious child i was raveling a thread wasn't even thinking about your father but now that i am i'll say this atticus finch is the same in his house as he is on the public streets how'd you like some fresh poundcake to take home i liked it very much next morning when i awakened i found jem and dill in the back yard deep in conversation when i joined them as usual they said go away will not this yard's as much mine as it is yours jem finch i got just as much right to play in it as you have dill and jem emerged from a brief huddle if you stay you've got to do what we tell you dill warned we ll i said who's so high and mighty all of a sudden if you don't say you'll do what we tell you we ain't gonna tell you anything dill continued you act like you grew ten inches in the night all right what is it jem said placidly we are going to give a note to boo radley just how i was trying to fight down the automatic terror rising in me it was all right for miss maudie to talkshe was old and snug on her porch it was different for us jem was merely going to put the note on the end of a fishing pole and stick it through the shutters if anyone came along dill would ring the bell dill raised his right hand in it was my mother's silver dinner bell i'm goin' around to the side of the house said jem we looked yesterday from across the street and there's a shutter loose think maybe i can make it stick on the window sill at least jem now you're in it and you can't get out of it you'll just stay in it miss priss okay okay but i don't wanta watch jem somebody was yes you will you'll watch the back end of the lot and dill's gonna watch the front of the house an' up the street an' if anybody comes he'll ring the bell that clear all right then what'd you write him dill said we're askin' him real politely to come out sometimes and tell us what he does in therewe said we wouldn't hurt him and we'd buy him an ice cream you all've gone crazy he'll kill us dill said it's my idea i figure if he'd come out and sit a spell with us he might feel better how do you know he don't feel good well how'd you feel if you'd been shut up for a hundred years with nothin' but cats to eat i bet he's got a beard down to here like your daddy's he ain't got a beard he dill stopped as if trying to remember uh huh caughtcha i said you said 'fore you were off the train good your daddy had a black beard if it's all the same to you he shaved it off last summer yeah an' i've got the letter to prove ithe sent me two dollars too keep oni reckon he even sent you a mounted police uniform that'n never showed up did it you just keep on tellin' 'em son dill harris could tell the biggest ones i ever heard among other things he had been up in a mail plane seventeen times he had been to nova scotia he had seen an elephant and his granddaddy was brigadier general joe wheeler and left him his sword you all hush said jem he scuttled beneath the house and came out with a yellow bamboo pole reckon this is long enough to reach from the sidewalk anybody who's brave enough to go up and touch the house hadn't oughta use a fishin' pole i said why don't you just knock the front door down thisisdifferent said jem how many times do i have to tell you that dill took a piece of paper from his pocket and gave it to jem the three of us walked cautiously toward the old house dill remained at the light pole on the front corner of the lot and jem and i edged down the sidewalk parallel to the side of the house i walked beyond jem and stood where i could see around the curve all clear i said not a soul in sight jem looked up the sidewalk to dill who nodded jem attached the note to the end of the fishing pole let the pole out across the yard and pushed it toward the window he had selected the pole lacked several inches of being long enough and jem leaned over as far as he could i watched him making jabbing motions for so long i abandoned my post and went to him can't get it off the pole he muttered or if i got it off i can't make it stay g'on back down the street scout i returned and gazed around the curve at the empty road occasionally i looked back at jem who was patiently trying to place the note on the window sill it would flutter to the ground and jem would jab it up until i thought if boo radley ever received it he wouldn't be able to read it i was looking down the street when the dinner bell rang shoulder up i reeled around to face boo radley and his bloody fangs instead i saw dill ringing the bell with all his might in atticus's face jem looked so awful i didn't have the heart to tell him i told him so he trudged along dragging the pole behind him on the sidewalk atticus said stop ringing that bell dill grabbed the clapper in the silence that followed i wished he'd start ringing it again atticus pushed his hat to the back of his head and put his hands on his hips jem he said what were you doing nothin' sir i don't want any of that tell me i waswe were just tryin' to give somethin' to mr radley what were you trying to give him just a letter let me see it jem held out a filthy piece of paper atticus took it and tried to read it why do you want mr radley to come out dill said we thought he might enjoy us and dried up when atticus looked at him son he said to jem i'm going to tell you something and tell you one time stop tormenting that man that goes for the other two of you what mr radley did was his own business if he wanted to come out he would if he wanted to stay inside his own house he had the right to stay inside free from the attentions of inquisitive children which was a mild term for the likes of us how would we like it if atticus barged in on us without knocking when we were in our rooms at night we were in effect doing the same thing to mr radley what mr radley did might seem peculiar to us but it did not seem peculiar to him furthermore had it never occurred to us that the civil way to communicate with another being was by the front door instead of a side window lastly we were to stay away from that house until we were invited there we were not to play an asinine game he had seen us playing or make fun of anybody on this street or in this town we weren't makin' fun of him we weren't laughin' at him said jem we were just so that was what you were doing wasn't it makin' fun of him no said atticus putting his life's history on display for the edification of the neighborhood jem seemed to swell a little i didn't say we were doin' that i didn't say it atticus grinned dryly you just told me he said you stop this nonsense right now every one of you jem gaped at him you want to be a lawyer don't you our father's mouth was suspiciously firm as if he were trying to hold it in line jem decided there was no point in quibbling and was silent when atticus went inside the house to retrieve a file he had forgotten to take to work that morning jem finally realized that he had been done in by the oldest lawyer's trick on record he waited a respectful distance from the front steps watched atticus leave the house and walk toward town when atticus was out of earshot jem yelled after him i thought i wanted to be a lawyer but i ain't so sure now\n",
