      "{'chapter': 1, 'paragraph_num': 1, 'text': 'When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the \\nelbow. When it healed, and Jem’s fears of never being able to play football were \\nassuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was \\nsomewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand \\nwas at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn’t have \\ncared less, so long as he could pass and punt.\\n When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we \\nsometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells \\nstarted it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before \\nthat. He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea \\nof making Boo Radley come out.\\n I said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing, it really began with Andrew \\nJackson. If General Jackson hadn’t run the Creeks up the creek, Simon Finch \\nwould never have paddled up the Alabama, and where would we be if he hadn’t? \\nWe were far too old to settle an argument with a fist-fight, so we consulted \\nAtticus. Our father said we were both right.\\n Being Southerners, it was a source of shame to some members of the family that \\nwe had no recorded ancestors on either side of the Battle of Hastings. All we had \\nwas Simon Finch, a fur-trapping apothecary from Cornwall whose piety was \\nexceeded only by his stinginess. In England, Simon was irritated by the \\npersecution of those who called themselves Methodists at the hands of their more \\nliberal brethren, and as Simon called himself a Methodist, he worked his way \\nacross the Atlantic to Philadelphia, thence to Jamaica, thence to Mobile, and up \\nthe Saint Stephens. Mindful of John Wesley’s strictures on the use of many words \\nin buying and selling, Simon made a pile practicing medicine, but in this pursuit \\nhe was unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not for the glory \\nof God, as the putting on of gold and costly apparel. So Simon, having forgotten \\nhis teacher’s dictum on the possession of human chattels, bought three slaves and \\nwith their aid established a homestead on the banks of the Alabama River some \\nforty miles above Saint Stephens. He returned to Saint Stephens only once, to find \\na wife, and with her established a line that ran high to daughters. Simon lived to \\nan impressive age and died rich.\\n It was customary for the men in the family to remain on Simon’s homestead, \\nFinch’s Landing, and make their living from cotton. The place was self-sufficient: \\nmodest in comparison with the empires around it, the Landing nevertheless \\nproduced everything required to sustain life except ice, wheat flour, and articles \\nof clothing, supplied by river-boats from Mobile.\\n Simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the North \\nand the South, as it left his descendants stripped of everything but their land, yet \\nthe tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth \\ncentury, when my father, Atticus Finch, went to Montgomery to read law, and his \\nyounger brother went to Boston to study medicine. Their sister Alexandra was the \\nFinch who remained at the Landing: she married a taciturn man who spent most \\nof his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering if his trot-lines were full.\\n When my father was admitted to the bar, he returned to Maycomb and began his \\npractice. Maycomb, some twenty miles east of Finch’s Landing, was the county \\nseat of Maycomb County. Atticus’s office in the courthouse contained little more \\nthan a hat rack, a spittoon, a checkerboard and an unsullied Code of Alabama. His \\nfirst two clients were the last two persons hanged in the Maycomb County jail. \\nAtticus had urged them to accept the state’s generosity in allowing them to plead \\nGuilty to second-degree murder and escape with their lives, but they were \\nHaverfords, in Maycomb County a name synonymous with jackass. The \\nHaverfords had dispatched Maycomb’s leading blacksmith in a misunderstanding \\narising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare, were imprudent enough to \\ndo it in the presence of three witnesses, and insisted that the-son-of-a-bitch-had-it\\ncoming-to-him was a good enough defense for anybody. They persisted in \\npleading Not Guilty to first-degree murder, so there was nothing much Atticus \\ncould do for his clients except be present at their departure, an occasion that was \\nprobably the beginning of my father’s profound distaste for the practice of \\ncriminal law.\\n During his first five years in Maycomb, Atticus practiced economy more than \\nanything; for several years thereafter he invested his earnings in his brother’s \\neducation. John Hale Finch was ten years younger than my father, and chose to \\nstudy medicine at a time when cotton was not worth growing; but after getting \\nUncle Jack started, Atticus derived a reasonable income from the law. He liked \\nMaycomb, he was Maycomb County born and bred; he knew his people, they \\nknew him, and because of Simon Finch’s industry, Atticus was related by blood \\nor marriage to nearly every family in the town.\\n Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In \\nrainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the \\ncourthouse sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog \\nsuffered on a summer’s day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in \\nthe sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men’s stiff collars wilted by \\nnine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o’clock naps, \\nand by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.\\n People moved slowly then. They ambled across the square, shuffled in and out of \\nthe stores around it, took their time about everything. A day was twenty-four \\nhours long but seemed longer. There was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go, \\nnothing to buy and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries \\nof Maycomb County. But it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people: \\nMaycomb County had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself.\\n We lived on the main residential street in town— Atticus, Jem and I, plus \\nCalpurnia our cook. Jem and I found our father satisfactory: he played with us, \\nread to us, and treated us with courteous detachment.\\n Calpurnia was something else again. She was all angles and bones; she was \\nnearsighted; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard. She \\nwas always ordering me out of the kitchen, asking me why I couldn’t behave as \\nwell as Jem when she knew he was older, and calling me home when I wasn’t \\nready to come. Our battles were epic and one-sided. Calpurnia always won, \\nmainly because Atticus always took her side. She had been with us ever since Jem \\nwas born, and I had felt her tyrannical presence as long as I could remember.\\n Our mother died when I was two, so I never felt her absence. She was a Graham \\nfrom Montgomery; Atticus met her when he was first elected to the state \\nlegislature. He was middle-aged then, she was fifteen years his junior. Jem was \\nthe product of their first year of marriage; four years later I was born, and two \\nyears later our mother died from a sudden heart attack. They said it ran in her \\nfamily. I did not miss her, but I think Jem did. He remembered her clearly, and \\nsometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length, then go off and play \\nby himself behind the car-house. When he was like that, I knew better than to \\nbother him.\\n When I was almost six and Jem was nearly ten, our summertime boundaries \\n(within calling distance of Calpurnia) were Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose’s house \\ntwo doors to the north of us, and the Radley Place three doors to the south. We \\nwere never tempted to break them. The Radley Place was inhabited by an \\nunknown entity the mere description of whom was enough to make us behave for \\ndays on end; Mrs. Dubose was plain hell.\\n That was the summer Dill came to us.\\n Early one morning as we were beginning our day’s play in the back yard, Jem and \\nI heard something next door in Miss Rachel Haverford’s collard patch. We went \\nto the wire fence to see if there was a puppy— Miss Rachel’s rat terrier was \\nexpecting— instead we found someone sitting looking at us. Sitting down, he \\nwasn’t much higher than the collards. We stared at him until he spoke:\\n “Hey.”\\n “Hey yourself,” said Jem pleasantly.\\n “I’m Charles Baker Harris,” he said. “I can read.”\\n “So what?” I said.\\n “I just thought you’d like to know I can read. You got anything needs readin‘ I \\ncan do it…”\\n “How old are you,” asked Jem, “four-and-a-half?”\\n “Goin‘ on seven.”\\n “Shoot no wonder, then,” said Jem, jerking his thumb at me. “Scout yonder’s \\nbeen readin‘ ever since she was born, and she ain’t even started to school yet. You \\nlook right puny for goin’ on seven.”\\n “I’m little but I’m old,” he said.\\n Jem brushed his hair back to get a better look. “Why don’t you come over, \\nCharles Baker Harris?” he said. “Lord, what a name.”\\n “‘s not any funnier’n yours. Aunt Rachel says your name’s Jeremy Atticus Finch.”\\n Jem scowled. “I’m big enough to fit mine,” he said. “Your name’s longer’n you \\nare. Bet it’s a foot longer.”\\n “Folks call me Dill,” said Dill, struggling under the fence.\\n “Do better if you go over it instead of under it,” I said. “Where’d you come from?”\\n Dill was from Meridian, Mississippi, was spending the summer with his aunt, \\nMiss Rachel, and would be spending every summer in Maycomb from now on. \\nHis family was from Maycomb County originally, his mother worked for a \\nphotographer in Meridian, had entered his picture in a Beautiful Child contest and \\nwon five dollars. She gave the money to Dill, who went to the picture show \\ntwenty times on it.\\n “Don’t have any picture shows here, except Jesus ones in the courthouse \\nsometimes,” said Jem. “Ever see anything good?”\\nDill had seen Dracula, a revelation that moved Jem to eye him with the beginning \\nof respect. “Tell it to us,” he said.\\n Dill was a curiosity. He wore blue linen shorts that buttoned to his shirt, his hair \\nwas snow white and stuck to his head like duckfluff; he was a year my senior but \\nI towered over him. As he told us the old tale his blue eyes would lighten and \\ndarken; his laugh was sudden and happy; he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the \\ncenter of his forehead.\\n When Dill reduced Dracula to dust, and Jem said the show sounded better than \\nthe book, I asked Dill where his father was: “You ain’t said anything about him.”\\n “I haven’t got one.”\\n “Is he dead?”\\n “No…”\\n “Then if he’s not dead you’ve got one, haven’t you?”\\n Dill blushed and Jem told me to hush, a sure sign that Dill had been studied and \\nfound acceptable. Thereafter the summer passed in routine contentment. Routine \\ncontentment was: improving our treehouse that rested between giant twin \\nchinaberry trees in the back yard, fussing, running through our list of dramas \\nbased on the works of Oliver Optic, Victor Appleton, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. \\nIn this matter we were lucky to have Dill. He played the character parts formerly \\nthrust upon me— the ape in Tarzan, Mr. Crabtree in The Rover Boys, Mr. Damon \\nin Tom Swift. Thus we came to know Dill as a pocket Merlin, whose head teemed \\nwith eccentric plans, strange longings, and quaint fancies.\\n But by the end of August our repertoire was vapid from countless reproductions, \\nand it was then that Dill gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out.\\n The Radley Place fascinated Dill. In spite of our warnings and explanations it \\ndrew him as the moon draws water, but drew him no nearer than the light-pole on \\nthe corner, a safe distance from the Radley gate. There he would stand, his arm \\naround the fat pole, staring and wondering.\\n The Radley Place jutted into a sharp curve beyond our house. Walking south, one \\nfaced its porch; the sidewalk turned and ran beside the lot. The house was low, \\nwas once white with a deep front porch and green shutters, but had long ago \\ndarkened to the color of the slate-gray yard around it. Rain-rotted shingles \\ndrooped over the eaves of the veranda; oak trees kept the sun away. The remains \\nof a picket drunkenly guarded the front yard— a “swept” yard that was never \\nswept— where johnson grass and rabbit-tobacco grew in abundance.\\n Inside the house lived a malevolent phantom. People said he existed, but Jem and \\nI had never seen him. People said he went out at night when the moon was down, \\nand peeped in windows. When people’s azaleas froze in a cold snap, it was \\nbecause he had breathed on them. Any stealthy small crimes committed in \\nMaycomb were his work. Once the town was terrorized by a series of morbid \\nnocturnal events: people’s chickens and household pets were found mutilated; \\nalthough the culprit was Crazy Addie, who eventually drowned himself in \\nBarker’s Eddy, people still looked at the Radley Place, unwilling to discard their \\ninitial suspicions. A Negro would not pass the Radley Place at night, he would cut \\nacross to the sidewalk opposite and whistle as he walked. The Maycomb school \\ngrounds adjoined the back of the Radley lot; from the Radley chickenyard tall \\npecan trees shook their fruit into the schoolyard, but the nuts lay untouched by the \\nchildren: Radley pecans would kill you. A baseball hit into the Radley yard was a \\nlost ball and no questions asked.\\n The misery of that house began many years before Jem and I were born. The \\nRadleys, welcome anywhere in town, kept to themselves, a predilection \\nunforgivable in Maycomb. They did not go to church, Maycomb’s principal \\nrecreation, but worshiped at home; Mrs. Radley seldom if ever crossed the street \\nfor a mid-morning coffee break with her neighbors, and certainly never joined a \\nmissionary circle. Mr. Radley walked to town at eleven-thirty every morning and \\ncame back promptly at twelve, sometimes carrying a brown paper bag that the \\nneighborhood assumed contained the family groceries. I never knew how old Mr. \\nRadley made his living— Jem said he “bought cotton,” a polite term for doing \\nnothing—but Mr. Radley and his wife had lived there with their two sons as long \\nas anybody could remember.\\n The shutters and doors of the Radley house were closed on Sundays, another \\nthing alien to Maycomb’s ways: closed doors meant illness and cold weather \\nonly. Of all days Sunday was the day for formal afternoon visiting: ladies wore \\ncorsets, men wore coats, children wore shoes. But to climb the Radley front steps \\nand call, “He-y,” of a Sunday afternoon was something their neighbors never did. \\nThe Radley house had no screen doors. I once asked Atticus if it ever had any; \\nAtticus said yes, but before I was born.\\n According to neighborhood legend, when the younger Radley boy was in his \\nteens he became acquainted with some of the Cunninghams from Old Sarum, an \\nenormous and confusing tribe domiciled in the northern part of the county, and \\nthey formed the nearest thing to a gang ever seen in Maycomb. They did little, but \\nenough to be discussed by the town and publicly warned from three pulpits: they \\nhung around the barbershop; they rode the bus to Abbottsville on Sundays and \\nwent to the picture show; they attended dances at the county’s riverside gambling \\nhell, the Dew-Drop Inn & Fishing Camp; they experimented with stumphole \\nwhiskey. Nobody in Maycomb had nerve enough to tell Mr. Radley that his boy \\nwas in with the wrong crowd.\\n One night, in an excessive spurt of high spirits, the boys backed around the square \\nin a borrowed flivver, resisted arrest by Maycomb’s ancient beadle, Mr. Conner, \\nand locked him in the courthouse outhouse. The town decided something had to \\nbe done; Mr. Conner said he knew who each and every one of them was, and he \\nwas bound and determined they wouldn’t get away with it, so the boys came \\nbefore the probate judge on charges of disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, \\nassault and battery, and using abusive and profane language in the presence and \\nhearing of a female. The judge asked Mr. Conner why he included the last charge; \\nMr. Conner said they cussed so loud he was sure every lady in Maycomb heard \\nthem. The judge decided to send the boys to the state industrial school, where \\nboys were sometimes sent for no other reason than to provide them with food and \\ndecent shelter: it was no prison and it was no disgrace. Mr. Radley thought it was. \\nIf the judge released Arthur, Mr. Radley would see to it that Arthur gave no \\nfurther trouble. Knowing that Mr. Radley’s word was his bond, the judge was \\nglad to do so.\\n The other boys attended the industrial school and received the best secondary \\neducation to be had in the state; one of them eventually worked his way through \\nengineering school at Auburn. The doors of the Radley house were closed on \\nweekdays as well as Sundays, and Mr. Radley’s boy was not seen again for \\nfifteen years.\\n But there came a day, barely within Jem’s memory, when Boo Radley was heard \\nfrom and was seen by several people, but not by Jem. He said Atticus never talked \\nmuch about the Radleys: when Jem would question him Atticus’s only answer \\nwas for him to mind his own business and let the Radleys mind theirs, they had a \\nright to; but when it happened Jem said Atticus shook his head and said, “Mm, \\nmm, mm.”\\n So Jem received most of his information from Miss Stephanie Crawford, a \\nneighborhood scold, who said she knew the whole thing. According to Miss \\nStephanie, Boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from The \\nMaycomb Tribune to paste in his scrapbook. His father entered the room. As Mr. \\nRadley passed by, Boo drove the scissors into his parent’s leg, pulled them out, \\nwiped them on his pants, and resumed his activities.\\n Mrs. Radley ran screaming into the street that Arthur was killing them all, but \\nwhen the sheriff arrived he found Boo still sitting in the livingroom, cutting up the \\nTribune. He was thirty-three years old then.\\n Miss Stephanie said old Mr. Radley said no Radley was going to any asylum, \\nwhen it was suggested that a season in Tuscaloosa might be helpful to Boo. Boo \\nwasn’t crazy, he was high-strung at times. It was all right to shut him up, Mr. \\nRadley conceded, but insisted that Boo not be charged with anything: he was not \\na criminal. The sheriff hadn’t the heart to put him in jail alongside Negroes, so \\nBoo was locked in the courthouse basement.\\n Boo’s transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in Jem’s memory. \\nMiss Stephanie Crawford said some of the town council told Mr. Radley that if he \\ndidn’t take Boo back, Boo would die of mold from the damp. Besides, Boo could \\nnot live forever on the bounty of the county.\\n Nobody knew what form of intimidation Mr. Radley employed to keep Boo out of \\nsight, but Jem figured that Mr. Radley kept him chained to the bed most of the \\ntime. Atticus said no, it wasn’t that sort of thing, that there were other ways of \\nmaking people into ghosts.\\n My memory came alive to see Mrs. Radley occasionally open the front door, walk \\nto the edge of the porch, and pour water on her cannas. But every day Jem and I \\nwould see Mr. Radley walking to and from town. He was a thin leathery man with \\ncolorless eyes, so colorless they did not reflect light. His cheekbones were sharp \\nand his mouth was wide, with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip. Miss Stephanie \\nCrawford said he was so upright he took the word of God as his only law, and we \\nbelieved her, because Mr. Radley’s posture was ramrod straight.\\n He never spoke to us. When he passed we would look at the ground and say, \\n“Good morning, sir,” and he would cough in reply. Mr. Radley’s elder son lived \\nin Pensacola; he came home at Christmas, and he was one of the few persons we \\never saw enter or leave the place. From the day Mr. Radley took Arthur home, \\npeople said the house died.\\n But there came a day when Atticus told us he’d wear us out if we made any noise \\nin the yard and commissioned Calpurnia to serve in his absence if she heard a \\nsound out of us. Mr. Radley was dying.\\n He took his time about it. Wooden sawhorses blocked the road at each end of the \\nRadley lot, straw was put down on the sidewalk, traffic was diverted to the back \\nstreet. Dr. Reynolds parked his car in front of our house and walked to the \\nRadley’s every time he called. Jem and I crept around the yard for days. At last \\nthe sawhorses were taken away, and we stood watching from the front porch \\nwhen Mr. Radley made his final journey past our house.\\n “There goes the meanest man ever God blew breath into,” murmured Calpurnia, \\nand she spat meditatively into the yard. We looked at her in surprise, for \\nCalpurnia rarely commented on the ways of white people.\\n The neighborhood thought when Mr. Radley went under Boo would come out, \\nbut it had another think coming: Boo’s elder brother returned from Pensacola and \\ntook Mr. Radley’s place. The only difference between him and his father was \\ntheir ages. Jem said Mr. Nathan Radley “bought cotton,” too. Mr. Nathan would \\nspeak to us, however, when we said good morning, and sometimes we saw him \\ncoming from town with a magazine in his hand.\\n The more we told Dill about the Radleys, the more he wanted to know, the longer \\nhe would stand hugging the light-pole on the corner, the more he would wonder.\\n “Wonder what he does in there,” he would murmur. “Looks like he’d just stick \\nhis head out the door.”\\nJem said, “He goes out, all right, when it’s pitch dark. Miss Stephanie Crawford \\nsaid she woke up in the middle of the night one time and saw him looking straight \\nthrough the window at her… said his head was like a skull lookin‘ at her. Ain’t \\nyou ever waked up at night and heard him, Dill? He walks like this-” Jem slid his \\nfeet through the gravel. “Why do you think Miss Rachel locks up so tight at \\nnight? I’ve seen his tracks in our back yard many a mornin’, and one night I heard \\nhim scratching on the back screen, but he was gone time Atticus got there.”\\n “Wonder what he looks like?” said Dill.\\n Jem gave a reasonable description of Boo: Boo was about six-and-a-half feet tall, \\njudging from his tracks; he dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch, \\nthat’s why his hands were bloodstained—if you ate an animal raw, you could \\nnever wash the blood off. There was a long jagged scar that ran across his face; \\nwhat teeth he had were yellow and rotten; his eyes popped, and he drooled most \\nof the time.\\n “Let’s try to make him come out,” said Dill. “I’d like to see what he looks like.”\\n Jem said if Dill wanted to get himself killed, all he had to do was go up and knock \\non the front door.\\n Our first raid came to pass only because Dill bet Jem The Gray Ghost against two \\nTom Swifts that Jem wouldn’t get any farther than the Radley gate. In all his life, \\nJem had never declined a dare.\\n Jem thought about it for three days. I suppose he loved honor more than his head, \\nfor Dill wore him down easily: “You’re scared,” Dill said, the first day. “Ain’t \\nscared, just respectful,” Jem said. The next day Dill said, “You’re too scared even \\nto put your big toe in the front yard.” Jem said he reckoned he wasn’t, he’d passed \\nthe Radley Place every school day of his life.\\n “Always runnin‘,” I said.\\n But Dill got him the third day, when he told Jem that folks in Meridian certainly \\nweren’t as afraid as the folks in Maycomb, that he’d never seen such scary folks \\nas the ones in Maycomb.\\n This was enough to make Jem march to the corner, where he stopped and leaned \\nagainst the light-pole, watching the gate hanging crazily on its homemade hinge.\\n“I hope you’ve got it through your head that he’ll kill us each and every one, Dill \\nHarris,” said Jem, when we joined him. “Don’t blame me when he gouges your \\neyes out. You started it, remember.”\\n “You’re still scared,” murmured Dill patiently.\\n Jem wanted Dill to know once and for all that he wasn’t scared of anything: “It’s \\njust that I can’t think of a way to make him come out without him gettin‘ us.” \\nBesides, Jem had his little sister to think of.\\n When he said that, I knew he was afraid. Jem had his little sister to think of the \\ntime I dared him to jump off the top of the house: “If I got killed, what’d become \\nof you?” he asked. Then he jumped, landed unhurt, and his sense of responsibility \\nleft him until confronted by the Radley Place.\\n “You gonna run out on a dare?” asked Dill. “If you are, then-”\\n “Dill, you have to think about these things,” Jem said. “Lemme think a minute… \\nit’s sort of like making a turtle come out…”\\n “How’s that?” asked Dill.\\n “Strike a match under him.”\\n I told Jem if he set fire to the Radley house I was going to tell Atticus on him.\\n Dill said striking a match under a turtle was hateful.\\n “Ain’t hateful, just persuades him—‘s not like you’d chunk him in the fire,” Jem \\ngrowled.\\n “How do you know a match don’t hurt him?”\\n “Turtles can’t feel, stupid,” said Jem.\\n “Were you ever a turtle, huh?”\\n “My stars, Dill! Now lemme think… reckon we can rock him…”\\n Jem stood in thought so long that Dill made a mild concession: “I won’t say you \\nran out on a dare an‘ I’ll swap you The Gray Ghost if you just go up and touch the \\nhouse.”\\n Jem brightened. “Touch the house, that all?”\\n Dill nodded.\\n “Sure that’s all, now? I don’t want you hollerin‘ something different the minute I \\nget back.”\\n “Yeah, that’s all,” said Dill. “He’ll probably come out after you when he sees you \\nin the yard, then Scout’n‘ me’ll jump on him and hold him down till we can tell \\nhim we ain’t gonna hurt him.”\\n We left the corner, crossed the side street that ran in front of the Radley house, \\nand stopped at the gate.\\n “Well go on,” said Dill, “Scout and me’s right behind you.”\\n “I’m going,” said Jem, “don’t hurry me.”\\n He walked to the corner of the lot, then back again, studying the simple terrain as \\nif deciding how best to effect an entry, frowning and scratching his head.\\n Then I sneered at him.\\n Jem threw open the gate and sped to the side of the house, slapped it with his \\npalm and ran back past us, not waiting to see if his foray was successful. Dill and \\nI followed on his heels. Safely on our porch, panting and out of breath, we looked \\nback.\\n The old house was the same, droopy and sick, but as we stared down the street we \\nthought we saw an inside shutter move. Flick. A tiny, almost invisible movement, \\nand the house was still.'}\n"

       "'The summer sun hung low over Maycomb, casting long shadows through the dusty streets and swaying branches of ancient oaks. Jem and Scout Finch sat on the porch steps, their bare feet dangling, watching the world with wide, curious eyes. It was the kind of afternoon where time seemed to slow, yet the air was thick with a tension they couldn’t quite name.\\n\\nTommy Harris was new in town, a shy boy with a crooked smile who kept to himself. One afternoon, a window shattered at the church, and fingers quickly pointed toward Tommy. Rumors swirled — some said he was clumsy, others whispered darker things. But Jem and Scout, knowing the boy’s quiet kindness, couldn’t believe he was guilty of such mischief.\\n\\nAtticus, their father, sat stiffly at the kitchen table, the weight of the town’s silent judgments pressing down on him. “Sometimes,” he said, “people see what they expect to see, not what is true.” His voice was calm, but Scout caught the flicker of sadness in his eyes.\\n\\nThe trial was a schoolyard spectacle. Tommy, nervous and small against the towering accusations, tried to explain, but his innocence was swallowed by suspicion. The town’s fear painted him in shades of guilt, a stark contrast to the gentle boy Jem and Scout knew.\\n\\nIn the end, it wasn’t the truth that won, but the loudest voices in the room. Jem and Scout learned that innocence, like a fragile flower, can be mistaken for something else entirely — a shadow cast longer by fear and misunderstanding. And in that small town, where the line between right and wrong blurred with the setting sun, the children held tight to the hope that one day, truth would find its way back to the light.'"
