He still maintained, however, that Atticus \\nhadn’t said we couldn’t, therefore we could; and if Atticus ever said we couldn’t, \\nJem had thought of a way around it: he would simply change the names of the \\ncharacters and then we couldn’t be accused of playing anything. Dill was in hearty agreement with this plan of action. Dill was becoming \\nsomething of a trial anyway, following Jem about. He had asked me earlier in the \\nsummer to marry him, then he promptly forgot about it. He staked me out, marked \\nas his property, said I was the only girl he would ever love, then he neglected me. I beat him up twice but it did no good, he only grew closer to Jem. They spent \\ndays together in the treehouse plotting and planning, calling me only when they \\nneeded a third party. But I kept aloof from their more foolhardy schemes for a \\nwhile, and on pain of being called a girl, I spent most of the remaining twilights \\nthat summer sitting with Miss Maudie Atkinson on her front porch. Jem and I had always enjoyed the free run of Miss Maudie’s yard if we kept out \\nof her azaleas, but our contact with her was not clearly defined. Until Jem and \\nDill excluded me from their plans, she was only another lady in the neighborhood, \\nbut a relatively benign presence. Our tacit treaty with Miss Maudie was that we could play on her lawn, eat her \\nscuppernongs if we didn’t jump on the arbor, and explore her vast back lot, terms \\nso generous we seldom spoke to her, so careful were we to preserve the delicate \\nbalance of our relationship, but Jem and Dill drove me closer to her with their \\nbehavior. Miss Maudie hated her house: time spent indoors was time wasted.'}\n"

Yours very truly, Jeremy Atticus Finch.”\\n “He won’t know who you are if you sign it like that, Jem.”\\n Jem erased his name and wrote, “Jem Finch.” I signed, “Jean Louise Finch \\n(Scout),” beneath it. Jem put the note in an envelope. Next morning on the way to school he ran ahead of me and stopped at the tree. Jem was facing me when he looked up, and I saw him go stark white. “Scout!”\\n I ran to him. Someone had filled our knot-hole with cement. “Don’t you cry, now, Scout… don’t cry now, don’t you worry-” he muttered at \\nme all the way to school. When we went home for dinner Jem bolted his food, ran to the porch and stood on \\nthe steps. I followed him. “Hasn’t passed by yet,” he said. Next day Jem repeated his vigil and was rewarded. “Hidy do, Mr. Nathan,” he said. “Morning Jem, Scout,” said Mr. Radley, as he went by. “Mr. Radley,” said Jem. Mr. Radley turned around. “Mr. Radley, ah—did you put cement in that hole in that tree down yonder?”\\n “Yes,” he said. “I filled it up.”\\n “Why’d you do it, sir?”\\n “Tree’s dying.',\n",

Mr. Tate turned around. “He’s far from dead, Jem, he hasn’t got started yet.”\\n Tim Johnson reached the side street that ran in front of the Radley Place, and \\nwhat remained of his poor mind made him pause and seem to consider which road \\nhe would take. He made a few hesitant steps and stopped in front of the Radley \\ngate; then he tried to turn around, but was having difficulty. Atticus said, “He’s within range, Heck. You better get him before he goes down \\nthe side street—Lord knows who’s around the corner. Go inside, Cal.”\\n Calpurnia opened the screen door, latched it behind her, then unlatched it and held \\nonto the hook.

He had been under the bed for two hours, he \\nthought; he had heard us in the diningroom, and the clink of forks on plates nearly \\ndrove him crazy. He thought Jem and I would never go to bed; he had considered \\nemerging and helping me beat Jem, as Jem had grown far taller, but he knew Mr. \\nFinch would break it up soon, so he thought it best to stay where he was.

Then he rose and broke \\nthe remaining code of our childhood. He went out of the room and down the hall. “Atticus,” his voice was distant, “can you come here a minute, sir?”\\n Beneath its sweat-streaked dirt Dill’s face went white. I felt sick.
