He still maintained, however, that Atticus \\nhadn’t said we couldn’t, therefore we could; and if Atticus ever said we couldn’t, \\nJem had thought of a way around it: he would simply change the names of the \\ncharacters and then we couldn’t be accused of playing anything. Dill was in hearty agreement with this plan of action. Dill was becoming \\nsomething of a trial anyway, following Jem about. He had asked me earlier in the \\nsummer to marry him, then he promptly forgot about it. He staked me out, marked \\nas his property, said I was the only girl he would ever love, then he neglected me. I beat him up twice but it did no good, he only grew closer to Jem. They spent \\ndays together in the treehouse plotting and planning, calling me only when they \\nneeded a third party. But I kept aloof from their more foolhardy schemes for a \\nwhile, and on pain of being called a girl, I spent most of the remaining twilights \\nthat summer sitting with Miss Maudie Atkinson on her front porch. Jem and I had always enjoyed the free run of Miss Maudie’s yard if we kept out \\nof her azaleas, but our contact with her was not clearly defined. Until Jem and \\nDill excluded me from their plans, she was only another lady in the neighborhood, \\nbut a relatively benign presence. Our tacit treaty with Miss Maudie was that we could play on her lawn, eat her \\nscuppernongs if we didn’t jump on the arbor, and explore her vast back lot, terms \\nso generous we seldom spoke to her, so careful were we to preserve the delicate \\nbalance of our relationship, but Jem and Dill drove me closer to her with their \\nbehavior. Miss Maudie hated her house: time spent indoors was time wasted.'}\n"

As the novel progresses, Jem is moving from childhood innocence into a more mature understanding of the complexities and injustices of the world around him. Specifically, by the later parts of the novel, Jem is struggling with the harsh realities following the trial of Tom Robinson. He is grappling with the unfair verdict and the ingrained racism he witnesses in Maycomb, which deeply affects his sense of justice and morality. This internal conflict causes Jem to become more serious and introspective. Physically, he is also growing up—he is older and stronger than Scout, and his changing body mirrors the changes in his perceptions and attitude. Additionally, after the attack by Bob Ewell near the end of the novel, Jem is injured and unconscious for a time, which symbolizes the physical and emotional toll that the town’s prejudice and violence have taken on him. So, Jem is undergoing a painful but necessary coming-of-age experience, marked by both personal growth and the loss of childhood innocence.\""

His appetite \\nwas appalling, and he told me so many times to stop pestering him I consulted \\nAtticus: “Reckon he’s got a tapeworm?” Atticus said no, Jem was growing. I must \\nbe patient with him and disturb him as little as possible. This change in Jem had come about in a matter of weeks. Mrs. Dubose was not \\ncold in her grave—Jem had seemed grateful enough for my company when he \\nwent to read to her. Overnight, it seemed, Jem had acquired an alien set of values \\nand was trying to impose them on me: several times he went so far as to tell me \\nwhat to do. After one altercation when Jem hollered, “It’s time you started bein‘ a \\ngirl and acting right!” I burst into tears and fled to Calpurnia. “Don’t you fret too much over Mister Jem—” she began. “Mister Jem?”\\n “Yeah, he’s just about Mister Jem now.”\\n “He ain’t that old,” I said. “All he needs is somebody to beat him up, and I ain’t \\nbig enough.”\\n “Baby,” said Calpurnia, “I just can’t help it if Mister Jem’s growin‘ up. He’s \\ngonna want to be off to himself a lot now, doin’ whatever boys do, so you just \\ncome right on in the kitchen when you feel lonesome. We’ll find lots of things to \\ndo in here.”\\n The beginning of that summer boded well: Jem could do as he pleased; Calpurnia \\nwould do until Dill came. She seemed glad to see me when I appeared in the \\nkitchen, and by watching her I began to think there was some skill involved in \\nbeing a girl. But summer came and Dill was not there. I received a letter and a snapshot from \\nhim. The letter said he had a new father whose picture was enclosed, and he \\nwould have to stay in Meridian because they planned to build a fishing boat. His \\nfather was a lawyer like Atticus, only much younger.',\n",

His \\nfather was a lawyer like Atticus, only much younger. Dill’s new father had a \\npleasant face, which made me glad Dill had captured him, but I was crushed. Dill \\nconcluded by saying he would love me forever and not to worry, he would come \\nget me and marry me as soon as he got enough money together, so please write. The fact that I had a permanent fiancé was little compensation for his absence: I \\nhad never thought about it, but summer was Dill by the fishpool smoking string, \\nDill’s eyes alive with complicated plans to make Boo Radley emerge; summer \\nwas the swiftness with which Dill would reach up and kiss me when Jem was not \\nlooking, the longings we sometimes felt each other feel. With him, life was \\nroutine; without him, life was unbearable. I stayed miserable for two days. As if that were not enough, the state legislature was called into emergency session \\nand Atticus left us for two weeks. The Governor was eager to scrape a few \\nbarnacles off the ship of state; there were sit-down strikes in Birmingham; bread \\nlines in the cities grew longer, people in the country grew poorer. But these were \\nevents remote from the world of Jem and me. We were surprised one morning to see a cartoon in the Montgomery Advertiser \\nabove the caption, “Maycomb’s Finch.” It showed Atticus barefooted and in short \\npants, chained to a desk: he was diligently writing on a slate while some frivolous\\nlooking girls yelled, “Yoo-hoo!” at him. “That’s a compliment,” explained Jem. “He spends his time doin‘ things that \\nwouldn’t get done if nobody did ’em.”\\n “Huh?”\\nIn addition to Jem’s newly developed characteristics, he had acquired a \\nmaddening air of wisdom. “Oh, Scout, it’s like reorganizing the tax systems of the counties and things.',\n",

Cal, did you teach Zeebo?”\\n “Yeah, Mister Jem. There wasn’t a school even when he was a boy. I made him \\nlearn, though.”\\n Zeebo was Calpurnia’s eldest son. If I had ever thought about it, I would have \\nknown that Calpurnia was of mature years—Zeebo had half-grown children—but \\nthen I had never thought about it. “Did you teach him out of a primer, like us?” I asked. “No, I made him get a page of the Bible every day, and there was a book Miss \\nBuford taught me out of—bet you don’t know where I got it,” she said. We didn’t know. Calpurnia said, “Your Granddaddy Finch gave it to me.”\\n “Were you from the Landing?” Jem asked. “You never told us that.”\\n “I certainly am, Mister Jem.

Jem was frowning. “Jem…?”\\n Atticus spoke. “He can’t hear you, Scout, he’s out like a light. He was coming \\naround, but Dr. Reynolds put him out again.”\\n “Yes sir.” I retreated. Jem’s room was large and square. Aunt Alexandra was \\nsitting in a rocking-chair by the fireplace. The man who brought Jem in was \\nstanding in a corner, leaning against the wall. He was some countryman I did not \\nknow. He had probably been at the pageant, and was in the vicinity when it \\nhappened. He must have heard our screams and come running.

When Jem and I asked him why he was so \\nold, he said he got started late, which we felt reflected upon his abilities and \\nmanliness. He was much older than the parents of our school contemporaries, and \\nthere was nothing Jem or I could say about him when our classmates said, “My \\nfather—”\\n Jem was football crazy. Atticus was never too tired to play keep-away, but when \\nJem wanted to tackle him Atticus would say, “I’m too old for that, son.”\\n Our father didn’t do anything. He worked in an office, not in a drugstore. Atticus \\ndid not drive a dump-truck for the county, he was not the sheriff, he did not farm, \\nwork in a garage, or do anything that could possibly arouse the admiration of \\nanyone. Besides that, he wore glasses. He was nearly blind in his left eye, and said left \\neyes were the tribal curse of the Finches. Whenever he wanted to see something \\nwell, he turned his head and looked from his right eye. He did not do the things our schoolmates’ fathers did: he never went hunting, he \\ndid not play poker or fish or drink or smoke. He sat in the livingroom and read. With these attributes, however, he would not remain as inconspicuous as we \\nwished him to: that year, the school buzzed with talk about him defending Tom \\nRobinson, none of which was complimentary. After my bout with Cecil Jacobs \\nwhen I committed myself to a policy of cowardice, word got around that Scout \\nFinch wouldn’t fight any more, her daddy wouldn’t let her. This was not entirely \\ncorrect: I wouldn’t fight publicly for Atticus, but the family was private ground. I \\nwould fight anyone from a third cousin upwards tooth and nail. Francis Hancock, \\nfor example, knew that. When he gave us our air-rifles Atticus wouldn’t teach us to shoot. Uncle Jack \\ninstructed us in the rudiments thereof; he said Atticus wasn’t interested in guns.',\n",

He made two steps forward, then stopped and raised his head. We saw his body \\ngo rigid.

Tim Johnson leaped, flopped over and crumpled on the \\nsidewalk in a brown-and-white heap. He didn’t know what hit him. Mr. Tate jumped off the porch and ran to the Radley Place. He stopped in front of \\nthe dog, squatted, turned around and tapped his finger on his forehead above his \\nleft eye. “You were a little to the right, Mr. Finch,” he called. “Always was,” answered Atticus. “If I had my ‘druthers I’d take a shotgun.”\\n He stooped and picked up his glasses, ground the broken lenses to powder under \\nhis heel, and went to Mr. Tate and stood looking down at Tim Johnson. Doors opened one by one, and the neighborhood slowly came alive. Miss Maudie \\nwalked down the steps with Miss Stephanie Crawford. Jem was paralyzed.

Where’d \\nyou get it?”\\n “Took it off a drunk man,” Mr. Tate answered coolly. I was trying to remember. Mr. Ewell was on me… then he went down… Jem \\nmust have gotten up.',\n",

Fall, and his \\nchildren trotted to and fro around the corner, the day’s woes and triumphs on their \\nfaces. They stopped at an oak tree, delighted, puzzled, apprehensive. Winter, and his children shivered at the front gate, silhouetted against a blazing \\nhouse. Winter, and a man walked into the street, dropped his glasses, and shot a \\ndog. Summer, and he watched his children’s heart break. Autumn again, and Boo’s \\nchildren needed him. Atticus was right. One time he said you never really know a man until you stand \\nin his shoes and walk around in them. Just standing on the Radley porch was \\nenough. The street lights were fuzzy from the fine rain that was falling. As I made my way \\nhome, I felt very old, but when I looked at the tip of my nose I could see fine \\nmisty beads, but looking cross-eyed made me dizzy so I quit. As I made my way \\nhome, I thought what a thing to tell Jem tomorrow. He’d be so mad he missed it \\nhe wouldn’t speak to me for days. As I made my way home, I thought Jem and I \\nwould get grown but there wasn’t much else left for us to learn, except possibly \\nalgebra. I ran up the steps and into the house. Aunt Alexandra had gone to bed, and \\nAtticus’s room was dark. I would see if Jem might be reviving. Atticus was in \\nJem’s room, sitting by his bed. He was reading a book. “Is Jem awake yet?”\\n “Sleeping peacefully. He won’t be awake until morning.”\\n “Oh. Are you sittin‘ up with him?”\\n “Just for an hour or so. Go to bed, Scout. You’ve had a long day.”\\n “Well, I think I’ll stay with you for a while.”\\n “Suit yourself,” said Atticus. It must have been after midnight, and I was puzzled \\nby his amiable acquiescence.',\n",

Every move he made was uncertain, as if he were not \\nsure his hands and feet could make proper contact with the things he touched. He \\ncoughed his dreadful raling cough, and was so shaken he had to sit down again. His hand searched for his hip pocket, and he pulled out a handkerchief. He \\ncoughed into it, then he wiped his forehead. Having been so accustomed to his absence, I found it incredible that he had been \\nsitting beside me all this time, present. He had not made a sound. Once more, he got to his feet. He turned to me and nodded toward the front door. “You’d like to say good night to Jem, wouldn’t you, Mr. Arthur? Come right in.”\\n I led him down the hall. Aunt Alexandra was sitting by Jem’s bed. “Come in, \\nArthur,” she said. “He’s still asleep. Dr. Reynolds gave him a heavy sedative. Jean Louise, is your father in the livingroom?”\\n “Yes ma’am, I think so.”\\n “I’ll just go speak to him a minute. Dr. Reynolds left some…” her voice trailed \\naway. Boo had drifted to a corner of the room, where he stood with his chin up, peering \\nfrom a distance at Jem. I took him by the hand, a hand surprisingly warm for its \\nwhiteness. I tugged him a little, and he allowed me to lead him to Jem’s bed. Dr. Reynolds had made a tent-like arrangement over Jem’s arm, to keep the cover \\noff, I guess, and Boo leaned forward and looked over it. An expression of timid \\ncuriosity was on his face, as though he had never seen a boy before. His mouth \\nwas slightly open, and he looked at Jem from head to foot. Boo’s hand came up, \\nbut he let it drop to his side. “You can pet him, Mr. Arthur, he’s asleep. You couldn’t if he was awake, though, \\nhe wouldn’t let you…” I found myself explaining.',\n",

Atticus got up from his chair, but he was moving slowly, like an old man. He put \\nthe newspaper down very carefully, adjusting its creases with lingering fingers. They were trembling a little. “Go home, Jem,” he said. “Take Scout and Dill home.”\\n We were accustomed to prompt, if not always cheerful acquiescence to Atticus’s \\ninstructions, but from the way he stood Jem was not thinking of budging. “Go home, I said.”\\n Jem shook his head. As Atticus’s fists went to his hips, so did Jem’s, and as they \\nfaced each other I could see little resemblance between them: Jem’s soft brown \\nhair and eyes, his oval face and snug-fitting ears were our mother’s, contrasting \\noddly with Atticus’s graying black hair and square-cut features, but they were \\nsomehow alike. Mutual defiance made them alike. “Son, I said go home.”\\n Jem shook his head. “I’ll send him home,” a burly man said, and grabbed Jem roughly by the collar. He yanked Jem nearly off his feet. “Don’t you touch him!” I kicked the man swiftly. Barefooted, I was surprised to \\nsee him fall back in real pain. I intended to kick his shin, but aimed too high. “That’ll do, Scout.” Atticus put his hand on my shoulder. “Don’t kick folks. No\\n —” he said, as I was pleading justification. “Ain’t nobody gonna do Jem that way,” I said. “All right, Mr. Finch, get ‘em outa here,” someone growled. “You got fifteen \\nseconds to get ’em outa here.”\\n In the midst of this strange assembly, Atticus stood trying to make Jem mind him.',\n",

Dill \\nwas encumbered by the chair, and his pace was slower. Atticus and Jem were well \\nahead of us, and I assumed that Atticus was giving him hell for not going home, \\nbut I was wrong.

Then read this.” Jem would struggle the rest of an \\nevening through the speeches of Henry W. Grady. “Link, that boy might go to the chair, but he’s not going till the truth’s told.” \\nAtticus’s voice was even. “And you know what the truth is.”\\n There was a murmur among the group of men, made more ominous when Atticus \\nmoved back to the bottom front step and the men drew nearer to him. Suddenly Jem screamed, “Atticus, the telephone’s ringing!”\\nThe men jumped a little and scattered; they were people we saw every day: \\nmerchants, in-town farmers; Dr. Reynolds was there; so was Mr. Avery. “Well, answer it, son,” called Atticus. Laughter broke them up. When Atticus switched on the overhead light in the \\nlivingroom he found Jem at the window, pale except for the vivid mark of the \\nscreen on his nose. “Why on earth are you all sitting in the dark?” he asked. Jem watched him go to his chair and pick up the evening paper. I sometimes think \\nAtticus subjected every crisis of his life to tranquil evaluation behind The Mobile \\nRegister, The Birmingham News and The Montgomery Advertiser. “They were after you, weren’t they?” Jem went to him. “They wanted to get you, \\ndidn’t they?”\\n Atticus lowered the paper and gazed at Jem. “What have you been reading?” he \\nasked. Then he said gently, “No son, those were our friends.”\\n “It wasn’t a—a gang?” Jem was looking from the corners of his eyes. Atticus tried to stifle a smile but didn’t make it. “No, we don’t have mobs and that \\nnonsense in Maycomb.',\n",

       "    'text': 'What are you scared of?”\\n Mayella said something behind her hands. “What was that?” asked the judge. “Him,” she sobbed, pointing at Atticus. “Mr. Finch?”\\n She nodded vigorously, saying, “Don’t want him doin‘ me like he done Papa, \\ntryin’ to make him out lefthanded…”\\n Judge Taylor scratched his thick white hair. It was plain that he had never been \\nconfronted with a problem of this kind. “How old are you?” he asked. “Nineteen-and-a-half,” Mayella said. Judge Taylor cleared his throat and tried unsuccessfully to speak in soothing \\ntones. “Mr. Finch has no idea of scaring you,” he growled, “and if he did, I’m \\nhere to stop him. That’s one thing I’m sitting up here for. Now you’re a big girl, \\nso you just sit up straight and tell the—tell us what happened to you. You can do \\nthat, can’t you?”\\n I whispered to Jem, “Has she got good sense?”\\n Jem was squinting down at the witness stand. “Can’t tell yet,” he said. “She’s got \\nenough sense to get the judge sorry for her, but she might be just—oh, I don’t \\nknow.”\\n Mollified, Mayella gave Atticus a final terrified glance and said to Mr. Gilmer, \\n“Well sir, I was on the porch and—and he came along and, you see, there was this \\nold chiffarobe in the yard Papa’d brought in to chop up for kindlin‘—Papa told \\nme to do it while he was off in the woods but I wadn’t feelin’ strong enough then, \\nso he came by-”\\n “Who is ‘he’?”\\n Mayella pointed to Tom Robinson. “I’ll have to ask you to be more specific, \\nplease,” said Mr. Gilmer. “The reporter can’t put down gestures very well.”\\n “That’n yonder,” she said.',\n",

Even then, they ain’t worth the bullet it takes to shoot ’em. Ewell ‘as \\none of ’em.”\\n Atticus said, “I thought he got it all out of him the day he threatened me.

Scout, \\nyou heard him behind you—”\\n “Yes sir. When we got under the tree—”\\n “How’d you know you were under the tree, you couldn’t see thunder out there.”\\n “I was barefooted, and Jem says the ground’s always cooler under a tree.”\\n “We’ll have to make him a deputy, go ahead.”\\n “Then all of a sudden somethin‘ grabbed me an’ mashed my costume… think I \\nducked on the ground… heard a tusslin‘ under the tree sort of… they were \\nbammin’ against the trunk, sounded like. Jem found me and started pullin‘ me \\ntoward the road. Some—Mr. Ewell yanked him down, I reckon. They tussled \\nsome more and then there was this funny noise—Jem hollered…” I stopped. That \\nwas Jem’s arm. “Anyway, Jem hollered and I didn’t hear him any more an‘ the next thing—Mr. Ewell was tryin’ to squeeze me to death, I reckon… then somebody yanked Mr. \\nEwell down.
